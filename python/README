This directory contains the Python interface to libd3q15, a C LB
implementation.

The library is wrapped using SWIG (http://www.swig.org/) interface
files (*.i)

The setup.py file is Python's equivalent of a Makefile. Run

    $ python setup.py build

to build the extension module and

   $ python setup.py install

to install it! See http://docs.python.org/install/index.html for the
full details. Further documentation is in the source and accessible
with a Python interpreter's help() function. E.g.

     >>> import d3q15
     >>> help(d3q15.Lattice)
